# Formatter ‚≠ê
The reason for using the formatter is to format your cookies without having to ask staff, helpers, ect.. ect.. I have made this to make your life and the staff team's like easier, no more risking leaking your cookies to people you dont know (unless staff), no more waiting for someone to format cookies for you. AuroraCF does it all for you in less than 5 seconds, and its completely free.

# Installation‚¨ÜÔ∏è
1. Download Zip and Extract
2. Put your cookies in cookies.txt
3. Run AuroraCF.py (MUST HAVE PYTHON)
4. Your formatted cookies should be in bin/output.txt
5. Enjoy the open source tool and don't skid.
